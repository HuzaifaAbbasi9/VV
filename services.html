                                Supervised consumption is an NHS service which is used in certain conditions to ensure 
                                that patients take their medication at regular intervals such as in substance dependence. 
                                The prescriber writes the supervised consumption instructions on the prescription. The service 
                                is funded by the NHS, it’s free for the patient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This service will require the pharmacist to supervise the consumption of prescribed medicines 
                                at the point of dispensing in the pharmacy, ensuring that the dose has been administered to the 
                                patient. We offer a user-friendly, non-judgmental, client-centred and confidential service. We 
                                provide support and advice to the patient, including referral to primary care or specialist centers 
                                where appropriate. The service is carried out in a private consultation room.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the majority cases, the prescriber will discuss the options with the patient and refer them to 
                                the pharmacy of their choice for this service. Before reviewing the patient, the prescriber will 
                                check with the pharmacy the adherence of the patient to the treatment. If you would like us to provide 
                                this service for you, please speak to a member of staff or your prescriber.

                                The community dosage system is a service for those patients who take a large number of medications or who can’t 
                                remember to take their medications on time due to their conditions or circumstance. The pharmacy will put your 
                                medication in a weekly pack which is easy to follow, allowing better compliance and safe administration of medicines.
                                This service is being used by many of the elderly population to help manage complex medicine regimes. 
                            </p>
                            <p>   
                                This is an important tool that enhances medicine adherence and helps patients manage their medicine effectively. As a Pharmacy team, we understand how important it is to take medicine on time and not miss any doses which is why we can help organise weekly pill trays for those who require them and deliver them to the patients on a weekly basis. This will help prevent medicine wastage and overdosage in some patients.

                                The pharmacy will assess your eligibility for this service with you or your carer and the prescriber in some cases. Please speak to a member of staff about if you are interested in this service.

                                High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition which can be controlled to reduce your risk of a heart attack, 
                                stroke or other cardiovascular disease.
                                In the UK there are about five million adults (one in every nine) who have high blood pressure without even knowing it, since
                                 high blood pressure itself rarely causes symptoms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The British Heart Foundation estimates that high blood pressure causes over 50% of heart attacks and strokes        
                                We offer free blood pressure checks to people with no appointment necessary. This involves around 10-15 minutes 
                                in the pharmacy consultation room with a trained member of the pharmacy team. Depending on your blood pressure reading
                                you may be referred to your GP. 
                                The pharmacy team will guide you through any necessary steps depending on your blood pressure result.

                                The morning after pill as commonly referred is an emergency hormonal contraceptive pill which can be taken 
                                to follow unprotected sex to avoid pregnancy. It is recommended to take the pill as soon as possible after the sexual intercourse. If you require the pill, one of our pharmacists will carry out a short assessment by asking you to fill in a short questionnaire to establish if the treatment is suitable for you.

                                There are two drugs available in the UK without a prescription that are used as an Emergency Hormonal 
                                Contraceptives (EHC). Levonelle one-step and EllaOne. Levonelle One-step can be used for no longer than 72 hours of unprotected sex in order to prevent pregnancy. EllaOne is to be taken no longer than 120 hours after unprotected sex.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The pharmacist will advise you as to which contraceptive pill is suitable for you during a consultation. The morning after pill is not to be used regularly as it’s only for occasional use when another form of contraceptives was not used or failed. If you require the morning after pill, please speak to a member of staff who will get you to fill in a short questionnaire. The pharmacist will go through the questionnaire with you and if it suitable, they will supply the pill or they will refer you to another service if the tablet is not suitable for you..

                                If you have unused/expired prescription medicines or medicines that you bought over the counter, just bring them to the pharmacy for a safe disposal. This is a free service available to the public. It is not safe to put unwanted/expired medicine in domestic bins.
                                Any medicine you return to the pharmacy cannot be used by the pharmacy again. 
                                                          
                                It’s therefore very important that you don’t stockpile medication at home and only request medication 
                                that you need. Stockpiling is also dangerous as there is a possibility of mixing your new medicines with 
                                your old ones and it is also a safety risk to children and others who might take them. Every year over £300 million
                                of NHS money is wasted by unused prescription medicines.

                                Each year, large quantities of unused and expired medications are dumped into bins or flushed down toilets and sinks. The effects on the environment and human health are unclear but the evidence is pointing to the presence of chemicals from prescriptions and over-the-counter medications in the soil, drinking water and the surrounding environment. It is very important that you return unwanted medicines to a local pharmacy for safe disposal. Speak to a member of staff if you have any questions about the disposal of unwanted medicines.

                                The New Medicine Service (NMS) is a free NHS service that provides support for people with long-term conditions newly prescribed a medicine to help improve medicines adherence; it is initially focused on particular patient groups and conditions.

                                The aim of this service is to improve patient adherence to treatment and subsequently reduce medicine wastage. Also, to reduce hospital admissions from adverse drug reaction by identifying them in the early stages of the treatment. During your consultations with the pharmacist, you will also be advised on lifestyle intervention that will help with management of your conditions.

                                The community dosage system is a service for those patients who take a large number of medications or who can’t remember to take their medications on time due to their conditions or circumstance. The pharmacy will put your medication in a weekly pack which is easy to follow, allowing better compliance and safe administration of medicines.

                                This is an important tool that enhances medicine adherence and helps patients manage their medicine effectively. As a Pharmacy team, we understand how important it is to take medicine on time and not miss any doses which is why we can help organise weekly pill trays for those who require them and deliver them to the patients on a weekly basis. This will help prevent medicine wastage and overdosage in some patients.

                                Supervised consumption is an NHS service which is used in certain conditions to ensure that patients take their medication at regular intervals such as in substance dependence. The prescriber writes the supervised consumption instructions on the prescription. The service is funded by the NHS, it’s free for the patient.

                                This service will require the pharmacist to supervise the consumption of prescribed medicines at the point of dispensing in the pharmacy, ensuring that the dose has been administered to the patient. We offer a user-friendly, non-judgmental, client-centred and confidential service. We provide support and advice to the patient, including referral to primary care or specialist centers where appropriate. The service is carried out in a private consultation room.

                                High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition which can be controlled to reduce your risk of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular disease.
                                In the UK there are about five million adults (one in every nine) who have high blood pressure without even knowing it, since high blood pressure itself rarely causes symptoms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The British Heart Foundation estimates that high blood pressure causes over 50% of heart attacks and strokes        
                                We offer free blood pressure checks to people with no appointment necessary. This involves around 10-15 minutes in the pharmacy consultation room with a trained member of the pharmacy team. Depending on your blood pressure reading you may be referred to your GP. 
                                The pharmacy team will guide you through any necessary steps depending on your blood pressure result.
